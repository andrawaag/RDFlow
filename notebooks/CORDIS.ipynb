Next, I will proceed to reconstructing the relation between the two sums, which will be conceptualized within the framework of Chinese causation theory. I will show that causality applies to the relations between parts that that the two mereological sums overlap. Next, I will proceed to a detailed reconstruction of the whole system, which will involve among others proving that with regard to parthood, the “atomless gunk” conception is more plausible than that of mereological singles. I will also discuss how the reconstruction is related to location, an issue that has been under intense discussion in contemporary mereological literature.\"\n",
